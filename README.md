Why not simply prove your solutions correct before submitting!
Writing in Coq allows a programmer to define specifications and prove that her programs adhere to such specifications within Coq itself.
Programs can then be extracted to Ocaml/Haskell and submitted to any judge that supports these languages.


## Compiling

Please ensure that you have Coq >= 8.12 and Ocaml >= 4.08.1.
To compile all programs (and generate the pretty documentation in the ```html/``` folder), run ```make```.


The styling for coqdoc is taken from [coqdocjs](https://github.com/coq-community/coqdocjs).
