Writing in Coq allows a programmer to define specifications and prove that her programs adhere to such specifications within Coq itself.
Programs can then be extracted to Ocaml/Haskell and submitted to any judge that supports these languages.




The styling for coqdoc is taken from [coqdocjs](https://github.com/coq-community/coqdocjs).
